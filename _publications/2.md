abstract: 'The concept of the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem (EE) has drawn a lot of attention in the fields of entrepreneurship studies, economic geography and urban economics, and have recently gained popularity with policy decision makers. While a long list of factors that influences entrepreneurship, few studies have so far looked at entrepreneurship from a truly systemic and interdisciplinary perspective that identifies explicitly cause and effect. This study proposes a two-stage structural model for the entrepreneurial ecosystem which identifies the factors which directly or indirectly influence regional entrepreneurial activities. <br/>We bring to bear a unique dataset in terms of size and composition, comprising of statistical information on various aspects of the entrepreneurial ecosystems of 263 Chinese prefecture-level municipalities from 2007 to 2015. The empirical results confirm our systemic modeling approach: human capital, knowledge creation and absorption, risk finance and market demand are the main factors in regional entrepreneurial ecosystems that promote local entrepreneurship directly. Moreover, presence of high growth firms in the region, startup companies, university graduates, as well as city openness are significant predictors of both the regional stock of human capital and knowledge creation. Risk finance is found to be strongly associated with the presence of high growth firms and startups. Last, but by no means least, the study also underscored the strong positive impact of universities on regional human capital and knowledge creation, thus indicating the crucial role of academic institutions in regional entrepreneurial ecosystems.'
