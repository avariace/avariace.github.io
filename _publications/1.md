abstract: '    This study proposes an inter-temporal conceptual model to examine the effect of different types of university-industry (U-I) interaction – contract research and intellectual property (IP) transfer – on university scientific productivity. Based on the empirical analysis of 59 Chinese research-intensive universities from 2010 to 2015, this paper finds that contract research commissioned by industry has an inverted U-shaped effect on university research, whereas IP transfer has a negative effect on university scientific productivity, and university internal R&D intensity weakens the effect of university-industry interaction on university scientific productivity. <br/>    In light of the growing trend in government promotion of university interactions with industry, this paper sheds light on university technology policy and indicates that academic engagement and commercialization should be treated separately by policy makers. Academic engagements with industry spurs research performance but over-dependence or proximity with industry might distract university research agendas and cause a reallocation of academic effort across activities which leads to decrease in scientific productivity. Meanwhile, increasing academic commercialization was found to be detrimental to the accumulation of openly accessible knowledge. As a result, policies aimed at promoting academic commercialization risks sacrificing the long-term benefits of scientific inquiry for short-term economic benefits.'
