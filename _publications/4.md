abstract: '    This paper aiming to understand the difference between returnee academics and non-returnee academics in terms of their innovation and entrepreneurial activities. Utilizing a panel data covering from 2007 to 2017 of 507 computer science faculties from 42 research-intensive universities in China, this study provides initial clues on how foreign educational backgrounds affect academicsâ€™ entrepreneurial activities. This study finds that academics with foreign educational background are more likely to involve into entrepreneurship, and returnee academics with a Ph.D. overseas are more likely to involve into entrepreneurship than returnee academics with only Postdoc experience overseas.'
